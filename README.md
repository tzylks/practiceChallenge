Welcome to the Pinkaloo Stack Showdown code challenge. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses Redux (https://redux.js.org) to manage the application state. The applicable reducers, actions, and selectors can be found in `src/modules/index.js`.

## Rules

The file `src/modules/mock_data.json` itself should not be modified. Consider this to be immutable data coming from an API.

## Tasks

- [x] Run the app using `yarn start`
- [x] Replace placeholder values in `CampaignDetails` component
	- Display total dollar amount of contributions for the campaign
	- Provide the campaign's goal progress to `ProgressBar `
- [x] Replace placeholder values in `CampaignContributions` component
	- Display the associated user avatar
	- Display the associated user name. Show both `first_name` and `last_name` if available
- [x] Sort campaign contributions by date. Newest contributions should display at the top
- [x] Add the ability to contribute to the selected campaign using the `DonateForm` component
	- Create an addContribution function in `modules` that accepts accepts `amount` and `campaignId` as input parameters and returns a redux action
	- Handle the created redux action in the app reducer and generate a full contribution using the `amount` and `campaignId`.
		- Example Contribution (all attributes required):
		``
		{
	        "id": 49,
	        "amount": 12.51,
	        "campaignId": "elastic",
	        "date": "2019-08-15T03:00:00.000Z",
	        "userId": 17
	    }
	    ``
	    - `id` should be auto-incremented using `(contributions.length + 1)`, `date` should be the current datetime JSON formatted, `userId` should be derived from `session.user.id`.
	    - The newly generated contribution should be appended to `state.transactions` in the action reducer
	- Decrease the user's available balance after successfully contributing
	- Show validation error in `DonateForm` component if user does not have the required funds to contribute
- [x] Prevent `ProgressBar` component from visually overflowing when `progress > 1.0`
- [x] Sort campaigns in `CampaignNavigation` by goal progress (total contributions / goal)
- [x] Resolve any generated warnings from Webpack & React that are displayed in the browser console

## Extras
- [x] Add message support in `DonateForm` component
- [x] Optimize data lookup (e.g memoize selectors or restructure redux state)
	- Memoization implemented with: [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) and [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)
- [x] Add your own feature to Stack Showdown!
	- Dynamic routing implemented with: [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [x] Run on AWS Amplify
	- Live view: (https://master.d3n8obzxhi9nwc.amplifyapp.com/)
